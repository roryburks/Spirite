# Spirite

Spirite is an Image Creation/Editing Software built in Java/Swing and JPen 2 for tablet input.  As of now it's pretty barebones but the UI is coming up very quickly and the initial features are being solidified.

At the time of conception it was being made with the intention of being geared towards animation, providing a variaty of ways to visually overlap keyframes and also constructing and displaying the animation with a minimal amount of extra input from the user.  So far very little of that is realized as I am focusing on implementing the core editing features that all image software needs.
