0x0001_0000:
    -NodeTypeID changed from Int (which it incorrectly was) to byte
    -Size of ImageData for Dynamic Images may be 0 indicating a null image
    -Per-node bitmask was previously marked as written before alpha/offset, when it's actually after.  This is not a I/O change, just an error in documentation
